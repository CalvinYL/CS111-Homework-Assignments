1a)

i) The following produce an error message:
'xyz'
'\'
'//'
ii) The lexical error is specified at the beginning of the error message


1b)

i) 100, 101, 102, 68, 69, 70,48, 49, 50 respectively
ii) The number we are given correspond to the letter/number we input into the command prompt. As the letter/number we input increases chronologically, the number we receive will experience the same amount of change.
iii) The first three produce a lexical error, but the next three provide a letter depending on the number that is added to 'A'. This letter is determined by how many letters it is away from the letter 'A'.
iv) (char) ('C' +4)


2a) Fixed program:

public class MyProgram {
    public static void main (String[] args) {
        System.out.println("This code is problematic!");
        System.out.println("Can you get it to compile?");
    }
} 


2b)

The following names are not valid identifiers:
'class' because an identifier cannot be the same as a keyword that is part of the language
'total value' because identifiers may not contain spaces
'7dwarfs' because identifiers may only begin with a letter, $, or _


2c)

System.out.println("///\\\\\\ \\\\// /'\\");
System.out.println("\"Hi\", said Perry. \"What's new?\"");
System.out.println("\"Not much\", said Libby. \"What's new with you?\"");

3) The output of the program is:

hello hello bye hello see ya hello bye
